# Chat Meet Application

## Overview
Chat Meet Application is a real-time chat application that enables users to communicate through text messages, make video calls, and share screens. The main goal of this project is to provide a seamless and interactive communication platform for users to connect with each other remotely. The application is designed to be easy to use and efficient, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for all users.

## Features
- **Real-time Text Messaging:** Users can exchange text messages in real-time, allowing for instant communication and efficient collaboration.

- **Video Call Functionality:** The application provides video call functionality, allowing users to have face-to-face conversations with each other regardless of their physical locations.

- **Screen Sharing Option:** Users can share their screens during video calls, making it convenient for presentations, demonstrations, and collaboration on shared documents.


## Project Details
The Chat Meet Application is built using a combination of powerful technologies and tools, making it a robust and reliable platform for communication. Here are some key details about the project:

- **Secure Authentication:** To ensure the security and privacy of user data, the application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. This prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only authenticated users can access the chat and video call features.

- **WebSocket Communication:** Real-time text messaging is implemented using WebSocket communication. WebSockets provide a persistent connection between the client and server, enabling instant message delivery without the need for constant polling.

- **WebRTC for Video Calls:** The video call functionality is powered by WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), a collection of communication protocols and APIs that enable peer-to-peer communication between users. This technology ensures high-quality video calls with low latency.
